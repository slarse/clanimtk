Overview
========
``clanimtk`` (Command Line Animation Toolkit) is a toolkit for quickly creating
custom command line animations.

Requirements
============
* For production use, only `daiquiri` is required (for logging).
* For development, see `requirements.txt`_.

Install
=======
Option 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``
----------------------------------------
The latest release of ``clanimtk`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with ``pip``.
I strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this
may land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install
can be done like this:

1. Execute ``pip install --user clanimtk`` to install the package.
2. Further steps to be added ...

Option 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``
-----------------------------------------------------
If you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded
to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.

1. Clone the repo with ``git``:
    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/clanimtk``
2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.
    - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.
    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.
    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.
3. Further steps to be added ...
