Overview
========
``clanimtk`` (Command Line Animation Toolkit) is a toolkit for quickly creating
custom command line animations.

Core concepts
=============
``clanimtk`` works with a few, simple core concepts that revolve around certain
object types. It is essential to have these in the back of the head to
efficiently use the toolkit.

* **Frame:** A string with fixed linelength. I.e., Either there is only
  one line in the string, or each newline character is preceeded by the exact
  same amount of characters.
* **FrameGenerator:** A ``FrameGenerator`` is any generator that has no
  sendtype nor returntype, and yields any number of ``Frame`` strings that
  have identical dimensions. That is to say, each ``Frame`` yielded by
  the generator must have the same amount of lines, and same linelength,
  as all of the others.
* **FrameFunction:** Any function that returns a ``FrameGenerator``.
* **AnimationGenerator:** A generator that yields an endless amount of
  ``Frame`` strings, but each ``Frame`` is terminated by backspace/up
  character such that printing the ``Frame`` results in the cursor ending
  up at its start position.
* **Animation:** Any function that returns an ``AnimationGenerator``.

All of these types, along with some other types used in the package, are
type-defined in the `types module`_. Do note that several of the types
are simply aliases of each other, or other existing types.

Knowing about these concepts, we can turn to the main functionality of
``clanimtk``, which is provided in the form of two decorators.

* **@animation:** Turns a ``FrameFunction`` into an ``Animation``.
* **@animate:** Given an ``AnimationGenerator``, ``@animate`` will print
  frames to stdout as long as the decorated function is running.

Using ``clanimtk``, the only thing you need to write yourself to create a
custom animation is a ``FrameFunction``. Decorating a ``FrameFunction``
with the ``@animation`` decorator will transform the function into an
``Animation``. Below is a minimal example with the default animation
of ``clanimtk``.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from clanimtk import animation

    @animation
    def hashes():
        return (("#" * i).ljust(4) for i in range(5))

The function returns a generator which yields the strings ``"    "``, ``"#
"``, ``"## "``, ``"### "`` and ``"####"``. Each has one line and is 4
characters wide, so by definition the generator is a ``FrameGenerator``, making
the function a ``FrameFunction``. Applying the ``@animation`` decorator
transforms it into an ``Animation``. The ``AnimationGenerator`` it returns
can be used with the ``@animate`` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    from clanimtk import animate
    import time

    @animate(animation=hashes())
    def sleep(duration):
        time.sleep(duration)
        return 42
        
You can see the not-too-impressive results in the gif below.

However, with some effort and perseverance, it's possible to create some pretty
cool animations:

Some more examples, including the scrolling text animation seen above, can be
found in the ``clanim`` package.

Requirements
============
* For production use, only `daiquiri` is required (for logging).
* For development, see `requirements.txt`_.

Install
=======
Option 1: Install from PyPi with ``pip``
----------------------------------------
The latest release of ``clanimtk`` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as usual with ``pip``.
I strongly discourage system-wide ``pip`` installs (i.e. ``sudo pip install <package>``), as this
may land you with incompatible packages in a very short amount of time. A per-user install
can be done like this:

1. Execute ``pip install --user clanimtk`` to install the package.
2. Further steps to be added ...

Option 2: Clone the repo and the install with ``pip``
-----------------------------------------------------
If you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release versions are uploaded
to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this yourself, I suggest going with the release version.

1. Clone the repo with ``git``:
    - ``git clone https://github.com/slarse/clanimtk``
2. ``cd`` into the project root directory and install with ``pip``.
    - ``pip install --user .``, this will create a local install for the current user.
    - Or just ``pip install .`` if you use ``virtualenv``.
    - For development, use ``pip install -e .`` in a ``virtualenv``.
3. Further steps to be added ...
